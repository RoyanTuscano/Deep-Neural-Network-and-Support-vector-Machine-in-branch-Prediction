We have seen lot of progress in machine learning and deep neural network from
year 2006.They have shown excellent performance in computer vision and Data
Analytics. In this project, we study the feasibility of the machine learning algorithm
support vector machine and Deep neural networks in branch prediction. We study
the branch prediction as a two-class classification problem. We compare the results
of our branch prediction analysis with Deep neural network and Support vector
machine using different hardware storage . We also observe that support vector
machine can be used in branch prediction and can offer good results. We have
also done design space exploration for the best local history register, global history
register for deep learning classifier and Machine learning.In our analysis, Deep
learning classifier performed better than Support Vector Machine algorithm.But the
Deep learning classifier has more implementation overhead compared to the Sup-
port vector machine. Also, we learned that the hardware of 10 Kbits performance
almost identical to the hardware of 1.6 Mbits, this hardware is used for storing
entries of local history.We have used incremental learning in both the classifier to
predict the branches.
